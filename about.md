      <p>
        I develop and apply advanced machine learning methods including generative foundation models such as GPT, deep learning, reinforcement learning, Bayesian non-parametrics, and Monte Carlo techniques to solve real-world problems involving large-scale, noisy datasets. I am particularly interested in building scalable, generalisable machine learning systems that can extract actionable insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of this, I created <strong>SurvivEHR</strong>, a survival foundation model trained on <strong>22.3 million</strong> patients and <strong>7.6 billion</strong> events, designed to generalise across multiple prediction tasks and deployment settings. My work has been published at leading venues such as NeurIPS and AISTATS. I have experience leading cross-functional research projects, managing academic and industry collaborations, and mentoring teams across BSc, MSc, and PhD levels.

      <p>      
      I earned a first-class honours BSc degree in Mathematics from the University of York, then progressed directly to a PhD in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Warwick (Departments of Statistics and Engineering), supervised by Sara Wade and Akeel Shah. After my PhD, I joined the Probabilistic Machine Learning and Computational Systems Biology groups at Aalto University, Finland, working with Samuel Kaski and Harri Lähdesmäki. I am now a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford in Christopher Yau’s group at the Big Data Institute and the Alan Turing Institute.
